## Small Company in LA: Pet Pride Cat Shelter
I chose to create a website for Pet Pride Cat Shelter in LA because one of my goals is to help stray/abandoned cats! I love cats.
They already have a website but it seems a little outdated. Here is their current website: http://www.petpride.org/stories.htm

Create website to showcase my abilities using React/JS
